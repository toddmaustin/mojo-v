# Mojo-V: Secret Computation for RISC-V

**Mojo-V** (pronounced *“mojo-five”*) is a new RISC-V extension that introduces privacy-oriented programming capabilities for RISC-V. Mojo-V implements secret computation, enabling secure, efficient, and data-oblivious execution without reliance on fragile software and programmer trust. By sequestering sensitive data in dedicated secret registers and encrypting memory under a third-party key, Mojo-V prevents disclosures and enforces computation that is both blind (no direct disclosures) and silent (no side channel leakage). The design integrates seamlessly into the existing RISC-V ISA with only a mode bit and four new instructions, enforced entirely at decode. Early results show near-native execution speeds while offering over 5-7 orders of magnitude performance improvement compared to fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), with a clear roadmap for integration into CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators.

# 🧩 Mojo-V Reference Platform — Release 0.92

## 🚧 Project Status

The Mojo-V reference platform release 0.92 implements secret integer and floating-point computation using a fixed symmetric key cipher. Mojo-V supports three encryption modes: fast, strong, and proof-carrying. As of this release, 64-bit secret computation is fully secretized and this early reference platform can be used for software development and red-teaming. Additional capabilities will be rolled out in future releases, including PKI support, LLVM compiler support, 32-bit RISC-V support, VIP-Bench benchmarks support, etc.

**Specification Version:** 0.92  (October 2025)  
**Contact:** [mojov-devs@umich.edu](mailto:mojov-devs@umich.edu)

## Current components

1. **Mojo-V ISA Spec v0.92**
   - released in `doc/`
2. **Spike (Instruction Set Simulator) Implementation**
   - Mojo-V integrated into `riscv-isa-sim`, nearly feature-complete
   - Missing only: Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) support (currently uses fixed keys with a Simon-128 cipher)
   - To run Spike with Mojo-V extensions enabled, add the `--isa=rv64gc_zicond_zkmojov_zicntr` flag when running `spike`
3. **Mojo-V Bringup-Bench Benchmarks**
   - Hand-coded examples (e.g., bubble-sort) showing Mojo-V working secret computation
   - Full battery of security tests for RV64GC+Mojo-V

Note, the remainder of the Bringup-bench benchmarks have NOT been ported to Mojo-V, as yet.

## ⚙️ Building and Running the Mojo-V Reference Platform

### A. Install a RISC-V LLVM Compiler
You’ll need an LLVM-based RISC-V cross-compiler capable of producing `RV64GC` binaries.

Here is a good place to start: https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html

### B. Clone the Mojo-V Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/toddmaustin/mojo-v.git
cd mojo-v
```

### C. Build the RISC-V Spike simulator with Mojo-V Support
```bash
sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler libboost-regex-dev libboost-system-dev
cd riscv-isa-sim
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=$RISCV
make
```

### D. Build and Run Mojo-V Bringup-Bench Benchmark Tests

1. **Build the Spike device driver**

   ```bash
   cd bringup-bench/target
   make
   ```

2. **Configure your compiler**

   Edit `../Makefile` and set `TARGET_CC` for the `mojov` target to the location of your LVM Clang-based RISC-V compiler.

3. **Build and test**

   ```bash
   cd ..                # go to the top-level bringup-bench directory
   make mojov-tests     # run all Mojo-V tests
   ```

   As an alternative, you can run an individual benchmark by going into its directory and running the following command.

   ```bash
   cd ../mojov-test
   make TARGET=mojov clean build test
   ```

| `mojov-test2` | Hand-coded data-oblivious integer bubble-sort benchmark with Mojo-V fast encryption (int,fast) |
| `mojov-test3` | Hand-coded data-oblivious floating-point bubble-sort benchmark with Mojo-V fast encryption (fp,fast) |
| `mojov-test4` | Hand-coded data-oblivious integer bubble-sort benchmark with Mojo-V strong encryption (int,strong) |
| `mojov-test5` | Hand-coded data-oblivious floating-point bubble-sort benchmark with Mojo-V strong encryption (fp,strong) |
| `mojov-pctests` | Hand-coded integrity checking test suite for RV64GC+Mojo-V that includes positive and negative tests for Mojo-V's proof-carrying encryption format (proofcarrying) |
| `mojov-sectests` | Hand-coded security test suite for RV64GC+Mojo-V that includes 130 pos + 245 neg tests == 375 total (int,fp,fast,strong) |

All test benchmarks are hand-coded assembly programs demonstrating Mojo-V ISA rules and security semantics. The other Bringup-Bench benchmarks have not yet been ported to Mojo-V.
